# Simple Notes App 📝

## Overview

This is a straightforward notes application built with **React.js** for the frontend and **Node.js** for the backend. It allows users to create, view, and manage notes without any database—data is handled in-memory for practice purposes.

---

## Features

* Create, edit, and delete notes
* Frontend built with React.js
* Backend API built with Node.js (Express)
* No database — data is stored temporarily in server memory

---

## Purpose

This project is designed as a practice exercise to strengthen skills with React.js and Node.js, focusing on frontend-backend communication without persistent storage.

---

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies in both frontend and backend folders:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the backend server:

```bash
node server.js
```

4. Run the React frontend:

```bash
npm start
```

5. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` to use the app.

## Notes

* Data will reset when the server restarts since no database is used.
* Ideal for learning API integration and React state management.
